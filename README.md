Grove current sensor ACS70331  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_ACS70331.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_ACS70331)
=================================  

![ACS70331](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41441945/44913532-42900300-ad60-11e8-8e51-bf8a2f2ab357.jpg)  


Introduction of sensor
----------------------------  
The current sensor is a direct current measuring no more than 2.5A.This can be used to measure system power consumption, realize current monitoring and so on.The current sensor outputs an analog voltage that varies linearly with current.

***
Usage:
==========  
Download all the source files. There are two examples for user to use.
>1. examples/Seeed_ACS70331_basis_Demo.ino ,open it in arduino IDE. Compile and download and run it on a arduino board.
>2. If you own an OLED, you can connect it to work with it.Open examples/Seeed_ACS70331_OLED_Demo.ino in arduino IDE. Compile and download and run it on a arduino board.

****
Notice:
=========
>1. This examples/Seeed_ACS70331_basis_Demo.ino is just a simple display demo by the serial port monitor.
>2. When there is no load, the display is not 0 and the error is large. You need to calibrate according to the following steps.
    1. The value of the sensorValue is read when there is no current load.
    2. Print out the initial voltage and assign it to the Vref.
>3. The maximum range is 2.5A
