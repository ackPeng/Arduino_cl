Grove High Accuracy Barometer Sensor(2SMPB-02E)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_2SMPB_02E.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_2SMPB_02E)
=================================  

![2SMPB-02E](https://github.com/Jenkinlu001/Seeed_Picture/blob/master/2SMPB_02E.jpg)  


Introduction of sensor
----------------------------  
>1.  High accuracy and small size barometric pressure sensor with low current consumption.
>2.  Measure barometric pressure and temperature with high accuracy.
>3.  Automatically power down non-working circuit to minimize power consumption.

***
Usage:
==========  
Download all the source files and open examples/basic_demo/basic_demo.ino in arduino IDE. Compile and download and run it on a arduino board.

****
Notice:
=========
>1. This example/basic_demo/basic_demo.ino is just a simple display demo for general use case.
>2. This example/basic_demo/basic_demo.ino USES NORMAL MODE, 24-bit precision.
>3. If additional precision and sleep time are required,get more detail from **datasheet** .
