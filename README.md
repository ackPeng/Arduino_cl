Grove touch sensor MPR121  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_MRP121.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_MRP121)
=================================  
 


Introduction of sensor
----------------------------  
The MPR121 features an increased internal intelligence plus Freescaleâ€™s second generation capacitance detection engine.

***
Usage:
==========  
Download all the source files and open examples/MPR121_demo/MPR121_demo.ino in arduino IDE. Compile and download and run it on a arduino board.

****
Notice:
=========
>1. This example/MPR121_demo/MPR121_demo.ino is just a simple touch/release demo for general use case.
>2. The pin INT on the board is stay high,When the electrode is touched(key is press),trigger a low level,then return to high.
>3. If you want to achieve a more precise control,Set sensor's baseline,threshold.
    Touch condition: Baseline - Electrode filtered data > Touch threshold 
    Release condition: Baseline - Electrode filtered data < Release threshold
    Get more detail from **doc/MPR121_touch_datasheet.pdf**
